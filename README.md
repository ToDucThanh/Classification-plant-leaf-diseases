# Classification-plant-leaf-diseases
## Build and experiment several architectures, tune hyperparameters and deploy best model using Flask.
This is the **Capstone Project 2** I did from March 2021 to May 2021 at my university.
*Dataset A*: This dataset consists of 39 classes of plant leaves and background without leaves.[1]
*Dataset B*: The second dataset was crawled down from a Kaggle competition (Cassava Leaf Disease Classification) [3].

The best performance is of EfficientNet B0.
