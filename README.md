# Classification-plant-leaf-diseases
## Deploy a plant leaf diseases classification model using Flask.
This is the **Capstone Project 2** I did from March 2021 to May 2021 at my university.

The EfficientNetB0 is the work of Maksym Shkliarevskyi, https://www.kaggle.com/maksymshkliarevskyi

*Dataset A*: This dataset consists of 39 classes of plant leaves and background without leaves.[1]

*Dataset B*: The second dataset was crawled down from a Kaggle competition (Cassava Leaf Disease Classification) [3]. I accepted the rules of Kaggle competition to use this dataset for education purpose.
